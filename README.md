                                                     ### Hi there, I'm Alba ðŸ‘‹ 
                                      And I would like to tell you something about me... <h1>
                                      
 <p align="center"> I am a full stack developer, currently working at Entrust Consultants. It all started after arriving </br>
from a long backpacking trip in Europe and finding jobs that did not satisfy me professionally.</p>
  
  <p align="center"> When I finished high school, I studied graphic design, website design, marketing, and e-commerce.</br>
So when I returned from my long journey, I decided to continue growing in the exciting world of technology.</p>

 <p align="center">  I went back to studying graphic design, to update my knowledge and did a full five-month Bootcamp.</br>
Currently, I am still studying, now I am doing a one-year full-stack master. I love to code, there is </br>
always a puzzle to figure out and lots of new things to learn.</p>

                                         I would like to show you some of my projects. 
                                  They are still in process but I am really enjoying doing them


- Auriga: Formed by a group of four people, we started this project in June. Auriga is a Spanish company dedicated to car service and maintenance.
It's built with React, styled-components and atomic design. We also use NodeJS and Express, and MongoDB as a database. You can see it in the following <a href="https://auriga-app.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">link, at the moment we only have the mobile version, so adjust the screen to see it well.
