                                                ### Hi there, I'm Alba ðŸ‘‹ 
                                      And I would like to tell you something about me... 

  I am a full stack developer, currently working at Entrust Consultants. It all started after arriving 
from a long backpacking trip in Europe and finding jobs that did not satisfy me professionally.
  
  When I finished high school, I studied graphic design, website design, marketing, and e-commerce. 
So when I returned from my long journey, I decided to continue growing in the exciting world of technology.

  I went back to studying graphic design, to update my knowledge and did a full five-month Bootcamp. 
Currently, I am still studying, now I am doing a one-year full-stack master. I love to code, there is 
always a puzzle to figure out and lots of new things to learn.

                        I would like to show you some of my projects. 
                 They are still in process but I am really enjoying doing them
