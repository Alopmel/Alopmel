<h3 align="center">Hi there, I'm Alba ðŸ‘‹ </br> And I would like to tell you something about me... </h3>

<hr>

<p align="center">It all started after arriving from a long backpacking trip in Europe and finding jobs that did not satisfy </br> me professionally. When I finished high school, I studied graphic design, website design, marketing </br> and e-commerce. So when I returned from my long journey, I decided to continue growing in the exciting </br>  world of technology. </p>

<p align = "center"> I went back to studying graphic design, to update my knowledge and did a full five-month <a href="https://www.wildcodeschool.com/es-ES">Bootcamp</a>. </br>
Currently, I am still studying, now I am doing a one-year full-stack master. I love to code, there is </br>
always a puzzle to figure out and lots of new things to learn. </p>

<p align = "center"> I am a full stack developer and currently work at <a href="http://www.entrustla.com/"> Entrust Consultants</a>.</p>
<hr>

<h3 align="center">I would like to show you some of my projects.</br>They are still in process but I am really enjoying doing them  </h3>

- <a href="https://keen-bose-1a7f8f.netlify.app/"> Scrum Mars </a>: This hackathon was a lot of fun. Only 24 hours but not least. On Mars, life is very lonely and there are few things to do ... So we decided to do a gamified scrum using React and Nojde.js, where astronauts depending on the tasks they perform, will earn bitcoins to exchange for better food, longer video calls with their families and more prizes. Thus the work becomes more bearable. <a href="https://keen-bose-1a7f8f.netlify.app/">Try here</a> to use this app, drop and drag tasks and feel like an astronaut!
